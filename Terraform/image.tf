# Adds the Flatcar image to OpenStack. Unfortunately, since the image is bz2-compressed,
# we can't instruct the server to download the file from the URL directly. Instead,
# Terraform will download the file to your machine, decompress it, and then upload
# it to OpenStack. This can be a costly operation depending on your internet speeds,
# so we mark this resource to not be randomly destroyed.
